# LogParserPlusApp
The LogParserPlus application, which uses Microsoft's Log Parser.

The code provided here should be that of version 0.3.1 BETA, which was released back in January 2010. A compiled version can be downloaded from http://jamesrskemp.com/applications/LogParserPlus_0.3.1.zip

You will need to download and install [Microsoft Log Parser](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24659) for this application to run, as well as .NET Framework 2.0.

Find a number of queries you can run with Log Parser at [Log Parser Plus](http://logparserplus.com/).

This project has rather effectively stalled, but feature and pull requests will be reviewed.
